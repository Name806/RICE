RICE is the Rust Intelligent Chess Engine. It is a project I am developing by myself with guidence from a series on youtube called Bitboard Chess Engine in C, by Chess Programming (https://www.youtube.com/@chessprogramming591)
My goal is to translate the code from the Bitboard Chess Engine in C to Rust, because I like Rust better.
I am also making some adjustments to the code that fit my style of writing code better.
Eventually, I will add a neural network to the evaluation function and figure out how to train it usiing machine learning.
For now, I am focusing on making a working chess engine.
